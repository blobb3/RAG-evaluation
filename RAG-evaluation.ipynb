    "### Task: Build a RAG Model Function\n",
    "\n",
    "In this task, you will combine all the steps from the previous tasks to create a reusable function for building a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) model. The function will process raw text documents, generate embeddings, and store them in a vector store for efficient retrieval.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### What You Need to Do:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Define the Function:**\n",
    "   - Create a function named `build_rag_model` with the following parameters:\n",
    "     - **`texts` (List[str]):** A list of raw documents or text strings to process.\n",
    "     - **`embedding_model` (str):** The name of the Hugging Face embedding model to use.\n",
    "     - **`chunk_size` (int):** The maximum size of each text chunk.\n",
    "     - **`chunk_overlap` (int):** The overlap size between consecutive chunks.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Implement the Steps:**\n",
    "   - **Step 1:** **Split Text into Chunks**\n",
    "     - Use `RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter` to split the provided `texts` into chunks.\n",
    "     - Ensure the function handles all documents in the list and combines the resulting chunks.\n",
    "     - Print the number of generated chunks for debugging purposes.\n",
    "\n",
    "   - **Step 2:** **Generate Embeddings**\n",
    "     - Initialize a `HuggingFaceEmbeddings` object using the provided `embedding_model`.\n",
    "     - Use this object to generate embeddings for the text chunks.\n",
    "\n",
    "   - **Step 3:** **Create a Vector Store**\n",
    "     - Use `Chroma.from_texts` to create a vector store from the chunks and their embeddings.\n",
    "     - Print the number of chunks stored in the vector store for confirmation.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Return the Vector Store:**\n",
    "   - The function should return the vector store so it can be used for retrieval tasks.\n",

    "\n",
    "In this task, you will define and initialize a generative model that can answer user questions based on a given context. This involves creating a prompt template, setting up an output parser, and initializing the language model for generation.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### What You Need to Do:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Define the Prompt Template:**\n",
    "   - Use the `PromptTemplate` class to define a template that specifies how user questions and the associated context are structured.\n",
    "   - Your template should:\n",
    "     - Include placeholders for the context (`{context}`) and question (`{question}`).\n",
    "     - Provide clear instructions for the model to generate answers based only on the context.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Initialize the Prompt Template:**\n",
    "   - Set the `template` argument to the system template:\n",
    "     ```python\n",
    "     system_template = \"\"\"\n",
    "     Answer the users question based on the below context:\n",

    "     Here is the question: <question> {question} </question>\n",
    "     \"\"\"\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "   - Specify the `input_variables` as `[\"context\", \"question\"]` to define the placeholders.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Set Up the Output Parser:**\n",
    "   - Use the `StrOutputParser` to parse the string output from the model.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Initialize the Generative Model:**\n",
    "   - Use the `ChatGroq` class to set up a generative model with the following parameters:\n",
    "     - **`model`:** Specify the model name (e.g., `\"llama-3.2-3b-preview\"`).\n",
    "     - **`temperature`:** Set to `0` for deterministic outputs.\n",
    "     - **`max_tokens`:** Set to `None` to allow the model to decide the output length.\n",

      "1. **Physical examination**: Examine people with suspected asthma to identify expiratory polyphonic wheeze and signs of other respiratory symptoms. Be aware that even if examination results are normal, the person may still have asthma.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Initial treatment and objective tests**: Treat people immediately if they are acutely unwell or highly symptomatic at presentation. Perform objective tests that may help support a diagnosis of asthma, such as:\n",
      "   - Eosinophil count (the number of eosinophils in a blood sample)\n",
      "   - Fractional exhaled nitric oxide (FeNO) test\n",
      "   - Spirometry (measuring the amount of air that can be forcibly exhaled from the lungs in one second, FEV1)\n",
      "   - Bronchodilator reversibility test (measuring the ability to reverse obstruction in the airways using medicines that widen the airways)\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Bronchial challenge test**: A test to measure airway responsiveness (bronchial responsiveness). It involves giving small increments of a bronchoconstrictor (most commonly methacholine) and measuring the FEV1 after each dose until it falls by a predetermined amount (usually 20% from baseline).\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Bronchodilator reversibility test**: A measure of the ability to reverse obstruction in the airways using medicines that widen the airways (bronochodilators).\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Eosinophil count**: The number of eosinophils (a type of white blood cell) measured in a blood sample. Their levels are raised in asthma and other allergic diseases, and less commonly with malignant diseases, parasitic infections, reactions to some medicines, and a small number of rare diseases.\n",
      "\n",
      "6. **FeNO test**: A test that measures the amount of nitric oxide (NO) present on exhalation, usually expressed in parts per billion.\n",
      "\n",
      "7. **FEV1**: The amount of air that can be forcibly exhaled from the lungs in one second (forced expiratory volume in one second).\n",
      "\n",
      "8. **Leukotriene receptor antagonist**: A type of oral medicine that blocks cysteinyl leukotrienes, used in the treatment of asthma and seasonal allergies.\n",
      "\n",
      "9. **Long-acting beta2 agonist**: A long-acting medicine that acts on beta-receptors in the airways to relax airway smooth muscle and relieve symptoms of asthma.\n",
      "\n",
      "10. **Interpretation of results**: An optimal cut-off value is difficult to give for FeNO, but a value of 50 ppb in adults and 35 ppb in children is agreed upon. The age at which a child can cooperate with tests will vary, but it is usually necessary to manage these children pragmatically based on symptoms and signs only.\n",
      "\n",

    "### Critique QA Pairs Using LLM Prompts\n",
    "\n",
    "In this task, you will evaluate each generated QA pair using the previously defined critique prompts for **groundedness**, **relevance**, and **stand-alone clarity**. The goal is to score and document the quality of each question based on the provided context and criteria.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "#### What This Code Does:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Iterate Over QA Outputs:**\n",
    "   - Loops through the `outputs` list, which contains the generated QA pairs (`context`, `question`, `answer`).\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Generate Evaluations:**\n",
    "   - For each QA pair:\n",
    "     - **Groundedness:** Uses the `question_groundedness_critique_prompt` to evaluate if the question is answerable based on the given context.\n",
    "     - **Relevance:** Uses the `question_relevance_critique_prompt` to evaluate if the question is useful for the intended audience.\n",
    "     - **Stand-alone Clarity:** Uses the `question_standalone_critique_prompt` to evaluate if the question is understandable without additional context.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Call the LLM for Each Criterion:**\n",
    "   - Sends the formatted prompt for each criterion to the LLM using `call_llm`.\n",
    "   - Stores the response in the `evaluations` dictionary under the respective criterion.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Parse the Results:**\n",
    "   - Extracts the **`Total rating`** (score) and **`Evaluation`** (text rationale) from the LLM's response.\n",
    "   - Updates the `output` dictionary with the scores and evaluations for each criterion.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Handle Errors Gracefully:**\n",
    "   - If any part of the process fails (e.g., LLM output is malformed), the loop skips the current QA pair and continues with the next one.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Update Outputs:**\n",
    "   - Adds the critique scores and rationale to each QA pair in the `outputs` list.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",

    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Step-by-Step Breakdown:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Convert QA Pairs to a DataFrame:**\n",
    "   - `generated_questions = pd.DataFrame.from_dict(outputs)`:\n",
    "     - Converts the `outputs` list (which now includes QA pairs and their scores) into a pandas DataFrame for easier manipulation and analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Display the Evaluation Dataset (Before Filtering):**\n",
    "   - Prints a subset of columns:\n",
    "     - **`question`:** The generated question.\n",
    "     - **`answer`:** The corresponding answer.\n",
    "     - **`groundedness_score`, `relevance_score`, `standalone_score`:** Scores assigned during the critique step.\n",
    "   - This provides an overview of the dataset before applying any filtering criteria.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Filter the QA Pairs:**\n",
    "   - Keeps only QA pairs that meet the following conditions:\n",
    "     - **`groundedness_score` >= 4:** The question is well-anchored in the provided context.\n",
    "     - **`standalone_score` >= 4:** The question is clear and understandable without additional context.\n",
    "   - **Note:** The `relevance_score` is not used for filtering here, but it remains part of the dataset for reference.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Display the Filtered Dataset:**\n",
    "   - Prints the filtered DataFrame to show the high-quality QA pairs that passed the criteria.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Convert to a Hugging Face Dataset:**\n",
    "   - `eval_dataset = datasets.Dataset.from_pandas(generated_questions, split=\"train\", preserve_index=False)`:\n",
    "     - Converts the filtered pandas DataFrame into a Hugging Face `Dataset` object, which is commonly used for training and evaluation in NLP tasks.\n",
    "     - The `split=\"train\"` argument designates this as a training split.\n",
    "     - `preserve_index=False` ensures the index from the pandas DataFrame is not carried over to the `Dataset`.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Purpose of This Step:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Dataset Refinement:**\n",
    "   - Filters out low-quality QA pairs to ensure only well-scored questions and answers are included in the final dataset.\n",
    "   - Focuses on groundedness and stand-alone clarity to improve the overall utility and reliability of the dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Final Dataset Preparation:**\n",
    "   - Converts the data into a format suitable for further evaluation or training machine learning models, such as Hugging Face models.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Quality Assurance:**\n",
    "   - Provides a visual overview of the dataset before and after filtering, allowing for manual inspection of the data quality."

    "\n",
    "This function evaluates the performance of the RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) system by comparing the system's generated answers to the true answers in a test dataset. The results are saved to a file for further analysis.\n",

    "\n",
    "#### What This Function Does:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Prepare the Output File:**\n",
    "   - Attempts to load existing test results from `output_file`:\n",
    "     - If the file exists, appends new results to the previous ones.\n",
    "     - If the file does not exist, initializes an empty `outputs` list.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Iterate Over the Evaluation Dataset:**\n",
    "   - Loops through the `eval_dataset`, which contains the test questions, true answers, and source documents.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Skip Already Evaluated Questions:**\n",
    "   - Checks if a question has already been tested (i.e., exists in the loaded `outputs`).\n",
    "   - Skips the question if it has already been evaluated.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Run the RAG System:**\n",
    "   - Calls the `answer_with_rag` function to:\n",
    "     - Retrieve relevant documents using the `knowledge_index`.\n",
    "     - Generate an answer using the LLM (Language Model).\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Print Results (Optional):**\n",
    "   - If `verbose=True`, prints the following details for manual inspection:\n",
    "     - The input question.\n",
    "     - The generated answer.\n",
    "     - The true answer from the dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Save Results:**\n",
    "   - Constructs a dictionary containing:\n",
    "     - The question and its true answer.\n",
    "     - The source document.\n",
    "     - The generated answer.\n",
    "     - The retrieved documents used to generate the answer.\n",
    "     - Test settings, if provided.\n",
    "   - Appends the result to the `outputs` list and saves it to the `output_file` in JSON format.\n",

    "\n",
    "#### What This Function Does:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Initialize the Evaluation Environment:**\n",
    "   - **`answer_path`:** Path to the JSON file containing the generated answers.\n",
    "   - **`eval_chat_model`:** The language model used for evaluation (e.g., GPT-4).\n",
    "   - **`evaluator_name`:** A string identifier for the evaluator (e.g., \"GPT4\").\n",
    "   - **`evaluation_prompt_template`:** The prompt template that defines how the evaluation task is framed.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Load Existing Results:**\n",
    "   - If the `answer_path` file exists, loads the previously saved results into `answers`.\n",
    "   - This ensures that previously evaluated answers are not re-evaluated, saving time and resources.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Iterate Over Generated Answers:**\n",
    "   - For each entry in `answers`:\n",
    "     - **Check for Prior Evaluation:** If the answer has already been evaluated by the specified evaluator (`eval_score_{evaluator_name}`), skip it.\n",
    "     - **Prepare the Evaluation Prompt:**\n",
    "       - Uses `evaluation_prompt_template` to format the instruction, response, and reference answer into the structured prompt.\n",
    "     - **Evaluate the Response:**\n",
    "       - Sends the prompt to the `eval_chat_model` (e.g., GPT-4) and receives the evaluation result.\n",
    "     - **Parse the Result:**\n",
    "       - Extracts `feedback` and `score` from the model's output, splitting on `[RESULT]` to ensure the expected format is followed.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Update the Results:**\n",
    "   - Adds the following fields to the current experiment:\n",
    "     - **`eval_score_{evaluator_name}`:** The numeric score assigned by the evaluator.\n",
    "     - **`eval_feedback_{evaluator_name}`:** The detailed feedback provided by the evaluator.\n",
    "   - Saves the updated `answers` list back to the `answer_path` file after each iteration for checkpointing.\n",

    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Step-by-Step Breakdown:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Create Output Directory:**\n",
    "   - Ensures that a directory named `./output` exists to store the results.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Define Configurations:**\n",
    "   - **`embedding_models`:** List of embedding models to test (e.g., `\"sentence-transformers/all-mpnet-base-v2\"`).\n",
    "   - **`chunk_sizes`:** List of `(chunk_size, overlap)` tuples to test different chunking strategies.\n",
    "     - Example:\n",
    "       - `[2000, 100]`: Chunks of 2000 characters with 100-character overlap.\n",
    "       - `[5000, 500]`: Larger chunks of 5000 characters with 500-character overlap.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Iterate Over Configurations:**\n",
    "   - Loops through all combinations of `embedding_models` and `chunk_sizes`.\n",
    "   - Constructs a unique `settings_name` for each combination to name the output files clearly.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Build the Knowledge Base:**\n",
    "   - Calls the `build_rag_model` function with:\n",
    "     - `texts`: The input data (e.g., pre-split chunks of the documents).\n",
    "     - `embedding_model`: The current embedding model.\n",
    "     - `chunk_size` and `chunk_overlap`: Parameters for splitting the text.\n",
    "   - Converts the resulting vector store into a retriever (`knowledge_index`) for querying.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Run the RAG System:**\n",
    "   - Iterates through the `eval_dataset` (assumed to contain questions and true answers).\n",
    "   - Calls the `answer_with_rag` function to:\n",
    "     - Retrieve relevant documents using the `knowledge_index`.\n",
    "     - Generate answers using the RAG chain (`rag_chain`).\n",
    "   - Appends the results to a list, including:\n",
    "     - The question, true answer, generated answer, and retrieved documents.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Save Results:**\n",
    "   - Saves the answers to a JSON file named based on the configuration (`output_file_name`).\n",
    "\n",
    "7. **Evaluate the Answers:**\n",
    "   - Calls `evaluate_answers` to:\n",
    "     - Critique and score the generated answers using the LLM evaluator (`eval_chat_model`).\n",
    "     - Update the saved results with scores and feedback for each answer.\n",

    "2. **Flexible Testing:**\n",
    "   - Tests multiple configurations for embeddings and chunking, enabling comparative analysis.\n",

    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Step-by-Step Breakdown:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Initialize an Empty List:**\n",
    "   - `outputs = []`: Prepares a list to store the results from all JSON files.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Load JSON Files:**\n",
    "   - `glob.glob(\"./output/*.json\")`: Finds all JSON files in the `./output` directory.\n",
    "   - For each file:\n",
    "     - Loads the JSON content into a pandas DataFrame using `pd.DataFrame`.\n",
    "     - Adds a new column, `settings`, to store the filename, indicating the configuration used for generating the results.\n",
    "     - Appends the DataFrame to the `outputs` list.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Combine All Results:**\n",
    "   - `pd.concat(outputs)`: Concatenates all DataFrames in the `outputs` list into a single DataFrame named `result`.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Normalize Evaluation Scores:**\n",
    "   - **Convert to Integer:**\n",
    "     - `result[\"eval_score_GPT4\"].apply(lambda x: int(x) if isinstance(x, str) else 1)`:\n",
    "       - Ensures all scores are integers, with a fallback value of `1` for non-numeric entries.\n",
    "   - **Normalize to Range [0, 1]:**\n",
    "     - `result[\"eval_score_GPT4\"] = (result[\"eval_score_GPT4\"] - 1) / 4`:\n",
    "       - Transforms the scores from the range `[1, 5]` to `[0, 1]`:\n",
    "         - Subtracts `1` to shift the range to `[0, 4]`.\n",
    "         - Divides by `4` to scale the range to `[0, 1]`.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Purpose of This Step:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Aggregate Results:**\n",
    "   - Combines evaluation results from multiple configurations into a single dataset, making it easier to compare and analyze performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Normalize Scores:**\n",
    "   - Converts the raw scores into a standardized format (`[0, 1]`) for consistent interpretation and comparison across configurations.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Preserve Configuration Context:**\n",
    "   - Adds the `settings` column to retain information about which configuration each set of results corresponds to.\n",
